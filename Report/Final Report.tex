\section{Introduction}

Rogue: 2125 is a rogue-like top down shooter game which incorporates tile mapping, resource management and statistical awareness such as skills and levels. The game sees the player dungeon crawling through innumerable procedurally generated levels which scale in difficulty as the game progresses. The player will have to kill enemies, discover secrets, enhance abilities and find the secret artifacts of the game to level up. These secrets will be in the form of hidden rooms which house better rewards for the player, like equipment or powerups. With this comes a high risk though - these rooms will naturally be more dangerous, if the player is feeling adventurous. \linebreak

Our scope was somewhat ambitious, but trying to keep the complex features realistic, robust and easy to understand. Within this specific genre of game, there is a very wide range of possibilities for features and gameplay components, which means the game could be infinitely big, or lightweight and small. Rogue: 2125 is a nice blend of both - the overarching gameplay is lightweight, easy to understand and fulfilling in reward - however, the backend features, namely tile generation, is complex in design and implementation. \linebreak

In terms of inspiration, the game draws certain gameplay points from games such as Rogue Fable II (kongregate.com) and Hotline Miami by Dennaton Games.
